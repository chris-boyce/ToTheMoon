Currently Using GetNamo plugin but it has a critical issue with Modules on all versions 0.2 to 0.4 
Hours Spent trying to fix 45 +
Current Implymention meant extracting the code from this module into the Source Code. Current Version Working (v0.2)

This is a fork from Mika 314, which worked will but I needed some of the Stop and Resume Functionality

Currently waiting on issues with the Forked version to get fixed to get the full functionality of Sys and User Prompting
