> **NOTE**: This tutorial is out of date. Updating it soon to show how you can use this plugin to: <br /> Generate images at runtime using `DALL·E 2`. <br /> Transcribe speech in any language using `Whisper v2-large`. <br /> Use the chat endpoint to power an NPC with `GPT-4` and `GPT-3.5-Turbo`.

## Types of Authentication
There are two ways to set the Api Key
- Assign the Api key directly in blueprints.

- Set the Api Key as an environment variable

## Blueprint Nodes
#### OpenAI Call Completions

- This async node sends an HTTP request using your `engine`, `prompt`, and `settings`.
